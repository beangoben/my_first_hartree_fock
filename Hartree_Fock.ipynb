    "In Quantum Chemistry, we are interested to calculate properties of atoms and molecules from first principles. To do so, we need to calculate/obtain the wavefunctions of atoms and molecules. A big challenge is that (many-electron) atom and molecule wavefunctions are many-body problems and exact expressions do not exist. Therefore, we must use a trial wavefunction and apply the variational principle to find the minimal energy wavefunction. A procedure that have been particularly useful to generate a trial wavefunction in quantum chemistry is the Hartree-Fock method. In the Hartree-Fock method, the electron-electron interaction term is replaced by the Coulomb and Exchange terms, that accounts for the \"average\" repulsion experienced by an electron in the field of the other electrons. The Hartree-Fock aproximation allows us to formulate the **many-electron** problem as a set of **one-electron** equations:\n",
